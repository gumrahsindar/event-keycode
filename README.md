# event-keycode

* Live Version: [Get Event Keycode](https://event-keycode.vercel.app/)

* This project was inspired by: [50 Projects In 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)

### Description

* I made an app that shows keyboard press events with their belonging codes. To accomplish that, I used the window, which is the top level object in the browser.
